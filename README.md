# PLCO Imbalanced Learning
This repository contains demonstration code for the three-step pipeline for biomarker effect evaluation proposed in our latest work. Each Jupyter Notebook represents one step in the pipeline. The order of the pipeline is expected to be:
1. find_similar_trend_features.ipynb
2. shap_group_comparison.ipynb
3. test_similar_features
